What's happening?


I'm Paul. This is my site to share this and that. I currently work for [Shared Services Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Services_Canada) as a z/OS [Mainframe](http://millennialmainframer.com/) Systems Programmer. I live in beautiful Barrie, Ontario with my beautiful [wife](http://kristenalary.com), son, and two mutts.

I'm a member of [Barrie Toastmasters](http://barrietoastmasters.org), an occasional skydiver and [FAA Senior Rigger](http://paratechies.com).

I love 'nerding it up' with [programming](https://github.com/paulywill) and [language learning](https://www.lingq.com/profile/paulywill/).
