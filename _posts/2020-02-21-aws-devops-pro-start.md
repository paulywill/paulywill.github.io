### Preamble

I prematurely [indicated](https://twitter.com/paulwillgamble/status/1220524505082355717) my intension of starting my AWS DevOps Professional Certification journey awhile back, as nudged by Quincy from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/). 

Unfortunately nightly fatigue, overflowing to-do items, and excuses always prevented me starting. 

Waiting to "*__feel like it__*" is a horrible game plan. 

It's going to be a long journey and decide to use this blog as my accountability as I pluck away, lunch hours, every night, and some mornings on them magic no gym rest days.


### Day 1 (take 2) Activities

- [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-hands-on/) started to watch the intro and some setup
- changed zsh theme to "Agnoster"; this led to a long segway [resolving wacky fonts](https://dev.to/mattstratton/making-powerline-work-in-visual-studio-code-terminal-1m7) 
- refreshed some AWS credentials
- created and pushed first repo to CodeCommit (well for this course, there was some actually very old repos from previous tutorials perhaps a year or two ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) 

### To-Do
- [ ] Master AWS Billing again and set learning budget
