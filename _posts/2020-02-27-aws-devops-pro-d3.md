### Day 3 Activities

- [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-hands-on/) deep dive on buildspec.yml

As with the [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/paulywill/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge I am sometimes unable to do consecutive days in a row. This week especially problematic with a sick day and then catching up with the day job, and the hyper active 4 yr old. :S

Regardless I decided to do another lunch learn, watched a 9min video on the [buildspec.yml](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) for CodeBuild in the Udemy course I'm following.

This quickly following by seeing if there was a buildspec for a previous [TDD repo](https://github.com/paulywill/superlists_v2) I created for the [_"Obey the Testing Goat"_](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) 
book.

Always fascinated and frustrated my coffee drenched brain is bouncing around old projects with one simple question, "Where the hell was I last?"

Multitasking and playing around, which I suppose is  learning to some degree, is also eaten up with always trying to update configs and dependency.

Did you know there's a new version of  ```aws cli``` and ```pip```, oh and ```oh-my-zsh```?
