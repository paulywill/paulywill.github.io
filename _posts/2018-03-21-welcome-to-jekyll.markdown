I've decided to finally getting around to fixing my site. Like many webdev projects I left my personally site to collect dust after a recent breakdown with Wordpress (again :S).

Do not get me wrong, I loved working with WordPress and the company [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) after reading Scott Berkun's [*'The Year Without Pants'*](https://www.amazon.ca/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633). However, WordPress was starting to become overkill for my rarely updated blog. All the plugins I had originally installed were long abandon by the developers; next I required a new version of PHP to be installed; database had to re-created; credentials long forgotten...

Thus the site sat for a few weeks with a lovely database error. I would occasionally receive a traffic report of zero visitors.

*sigh...*

I always have good intentions for the 'one day-itis'. Saying to myself, one day I'll get to mastering PHP and create a designer award winning theme to resolve my ugly site to something note worthy. This is a line I've been saying for approximately 4+ years.

It's time to let go and try something different.

Jekyll seems like a no-brainer for something static, simple, and easy to update with Github.

My ramblings will hopefully be a little more streamlined in my simple Atom text editor and error free. ðŸ¤ž
