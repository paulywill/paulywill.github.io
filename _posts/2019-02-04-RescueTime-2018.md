Finally getting around to zeroing my personal inbox and came across: this [RescueTime 2018 Report](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2018/B63TZJdORSGqF_4QQ9imcWXXlraNJqK7bhOlxfiT).

I often forget that I have RescueTime install on my laptop and will occasionally look at the weekly email reports to see if I've been productive and how much. 2018 was a focus on getting more coding under my belt and learning more about AWS through certification, and no surprise that's exactly what the report reveals.

Interesting to see how many hours are clocked and categorized automatically for later reflection. I highly encourage others to do the same.
