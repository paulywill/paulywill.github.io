AWS ChatBot and ChatOps has me hooked!

I can see the power but finding it tricky setting up.

### TIL
- AWS ChatBot(beta) is really easy to setup for notifications

- AWS SNS/Lambda/API Gateway Slack app on the other hand, not happening for me! Part of me suspects it's an IAM issue, but I'm seeing where things are falling apart. Need to learn more about logging to troubleshoot things.

I have a new [tutorial](https://medium.com/faun/deploy-merge-and-build-code-from-slack-in-aws-125507c85765) as a lead that's apparently an update from [another](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/use-slack-chatops-to-deploy-your-code-how-to-integrate-your-pipeline-in-aws-codepipeline-with-your-slack-channel/) I was following.
