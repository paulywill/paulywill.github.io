### AWS Summit - Toronto 2019

Here's my notes from the AWS Summit Toronto 2019:

- Was raining had to Uber to the Allandale train station
- Late arrival; missed breakfast
- Tweeted some nice pics and vids of I.C.E. protesters during keynote (meh.)

- Did a lab on CloudFormation approx 1.5hrs
- Missed lunch
- Gave contacts to 3 “vendors” IBM; DataDogs; and AWS support for Public Service
- Listen the following talks:
    - “AWS Workspaces”
        - PCoIP (fancy remote desktops)
        - VM on the cloud
        - Very cost effective

    - “Full-Stack Web & Mobile / AWS Amplify & AppSync”
        - Nail polish app example
        - AppSync covers multiple platforms
        - Amplify makes testing and deploying “better”

    - “Terraform and AWS” / Eric Wright
        - Very interesting; straight forward



- [ ] Check my damn Apple ID / LinkedIn…… again!
- [ ] Play with:
    - [ ] AWS AppSync
    - [ ] AWS Amplify
    - [ ] AWS Rekognition
    - [ ] AWS Cognito
    - [ ] Elastic Search
    - [ ] Terraform


- [ ] ONICA had a meetup every month in Toronto/ I think I joined the group
- [ ] Find more references and arguments for Terraform vs. CloudFormation and others (that Gruntwork article looked good)
- [ ] Reduce AWS monthly bill…… AGAIN
