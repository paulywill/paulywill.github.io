I've been reading more these days, probably explaining the need for reading glasses.

In the spirit of [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book), I've decided to starting actively taking **[notes and impressions]**(https://gist.github.com/paulywill/7f652249516107a42ba839267f3341fb) promptly after finishing a book to keep the takeaways fresh.

Oh, and the epic lunar eclipse during an overcast day is about to happen... during a work meeting. Very fitting. :P
