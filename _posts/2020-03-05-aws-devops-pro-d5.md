Late lunch study.
Was not feeling it so there was a bit of play today.

### TIL:
* Some CloudWatch Metric / Events
* Setup a testing Discord and Slack servers for some future Lambda/SNS testing with CodeCommit and CodeBuild automation

Immediately upon activating Slack and Discord the first time in months I'm flooded with side projects I once volunteered for.

Now that I do have some slack time in my life I can dip my toes when I'm not studying.

There's always the tendency of doing too much, in too many areas and spreading myself so thin that I always wonder why I become stressed. Go figure :S
