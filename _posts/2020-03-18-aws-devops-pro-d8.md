COVID-19 continues to have us all in lock-down status and finally pulling myself from [death dashboards](https://ncov2019.live/) and [Twitter feeds](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19) I jumped into some prep exams for the DevOps exam to get a feel of what I'm up against.

AWS certification loves to stump and word play on their tests it seems. I just attemped approximately 8 questions and tapped out before I'm too discouraged.


### TIL
- Massive knowledge gaps. That was a given, but my completion study time may be a prolonged estimate, maybe 100+ days
- This [Udemy Prep Test](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-practice-exams-amazon) appears to be a great resource, and besides the AWS documentation for everything under the sun, it does reference some great cheat sheets from [tutorialsdojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/)
