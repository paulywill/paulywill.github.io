Keeping with free data nerdery at its finest, there's my [2019 Rescue Time Report](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2019?utm_campaign=yearinreview&utm_medium=email&utm_source=u).

Apparently I saw an increase/improvement from [2018](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2018/B63TZJdORSGqF_4QQ9imcWXXlraNJqK7bhOlxfiT).

I realize this is humble bragging disguised as tool sharing, __*BUT*__ I am very fond of set and forget tracking and inspires me to create more automation and progress nudging in my life.
