Some more setup and cleanup as I continue the Udemy course. 

Something on the wish list is a subtle mastery of switching between screens, saving setups, and keyboard shortcut workflows.

*... searching...*

Aha! [Mission Control](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-multiple-desktops-mac-os-x/), the feature I never use.`CTRL-[arrow key]` as well.

To this day, I'm still an osx noob.

### TIL

- Finding all my rogue aws resources with `Resource Groups / Tag Editor`. Ironically I starred this answer already in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44391817/is-there-a-way-to-list-all-resources-in-aws). Good review for the wallet

- The connecting to EC2 instance withe browser feature; always used terminal with SSH in the past
