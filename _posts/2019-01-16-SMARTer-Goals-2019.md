Last night I gave a speech at my [Toastmasters club](http://barrietoastmasters.org){:target="_blank"} entitled [*"Smart(er) Goals for 2019"*](/assets/SMARTer_Goals_2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

It's always good review for everyone, including getting everyone to write a letter to themselves which they will receive in 2020.

Here's my SMART(er) Goals for 2019 (I'm sure this list will be adjusted throughout the year):

* Reduce some outstanding debt by $12K 
* Obtain my [Distinguished Toastmasters award](https://www.toastmasters.org/education/distinguished-toastmaster){:target="_blank"}
* Receive my AWS DevOps Professional certification (already received my [CDA](/assets/aws/aws_cda.pdf) last year)
* create an online "muse" to generate an extra $10K (not a very SMART goal right now... working progress)
* lose 25lbs with visible abs in my after photo
* **BONUS:** take family to Montr√©al this summer
