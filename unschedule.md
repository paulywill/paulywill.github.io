Several years ago I read a few books on procrastination from the public library. In ultimate irony, it took me awhile to read them.

One of the gems I walked away with is an idea called **Unschedule**<sup>*</sup>.

The idea is simple, block out all the time in a given week that you're doing something, count the remaining free blocks of time you have left.
